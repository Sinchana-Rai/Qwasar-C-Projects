# Welcome to My Cat

Submit directory	ex00
Submit file	my_cat.c

# Description
It's your turn to code the software cat!

Create a program called my_cat which does the same thing as the system's cat command used in the command-line.

Your program should read the content of each files which are received as an argument to your software. Unlike the real Cat command, you don't have to handle any options. :-)

[[examples]] language = "Javascript"

$>node my_cat file1
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>
Example Python

$>python my_cat file1 file2
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>
Example Ruby

$>ruby my_cat file1 file2
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>
Example java

$>java my_cat file1 file2
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>
Example Rust <3

$>./my_cat file1 file2
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>
Tips

Google: man cat
Google: YOURCODINGLANGUAGE open file
Google: YOURCODINGLANGUAGE read file
Google: YOURCODINGLANGUAGE close file (don't forget to close.)
For javascript folks:

Google Why does Node.js' fs.readFile() return a buffer instead of string :-)
